		I made myself a banana loaf this evening.  I've been trying lots of things in the bread maker lately and was very excited to see a picture perfect
		loaf slide seductively out of the pan when I tipped it over.  It steamed and folded over itself as I cut through it's buttery interior.  Hubsie and
		I had a field day as we shared the heel followed by a "proper slice" with a mug of milk.
		<br><br>
		After I was finished enjoying the hard earned dessert, a funny thing happened.  I remembered every fitspo image about clean eating I had ever seen.
		Flashbacks of the chocolate chips I had snacked on as well as a piece of cake I had eaten with friends a couple of days before played through my mind.  
		Thinking about the beginnings of my six pack made me feel anxious!
		<br><br>
		But I had no reason to feel anxious.  Looking like a fitness model is something I've been conditioned to desire, but it's not something that brings meaning to my life. 
		Although I felt proud when I started to see the second set of abs coming through, the mirror has never made me as happy as a good book or wing night with friends.  
		Learning and relating to people have been the reason for my existence.  If having these things in my life means sitting still for a couple of hours and eating a slice of banana 
		loaf then so be it.  I'm going to enjoy my dessert and I hope you do as well.
