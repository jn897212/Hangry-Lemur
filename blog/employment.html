		When I first arrived in New Zealand, I used my honours degree in mathematics to score a position working alongside a computer scientist, a mechanical engineer
		 and an IT specialist from India named Earnie.  It was employment at an Irish pub that brought us together: me serving customers while the 
		 others worked the bar.  Except for Earnie.  Earnie was a dishwasher.  The music was kept at tinnitus-inducing volumes which, when combined with my being a bit hard of hearing, caused quite a few mix ups.  
		 I will never forget the scarring experience of serving a regular chicken burger to someone who ordered gluten-free.  Despite the problems it caused, the music
		 was never turned down because it was believed that louder tunes encouraged customers to buy more drinks.
		<br><br>
		One evening, a terrible smell emanating from the men's washroom led the duty manager to the discovery of a customer who had been grievously overserved the 
		aforementioned drinks.  On his hands and knees in a puddle of vomit, the young man was attempting to clean the mess with his bare hands.  "Oh God no!  Stop it!"
		 cried the duty manager between dry heaves "Just get yourself cleaned up, Mate!".  The intoxicated customer made an attempt to stand, but slipped, furthering 
		 the damage.  After another unsuccessful attempt and with great effort he got himself unsteadily to his feet.  "Thanks Mate" he said, giving the horrified duty 
		 manager a rancid pat on the shoulder.  The customer then wiped his mouth and exited to the bar where he obtained another pitcher of Little Creatures Pale Ale.
		<br><br>
		After much arguing among the staff, it fell on Earnie from IT to make right the monstrosity that had become of the men's washroom.  For the next hour Earnie 
		could be heard, repeating incredulously to himself while mopping, "I have a masters degree".  I've heard that the smell lingers to this day.
		<br><br>
		Needless to say, as soon as the opportunity came along to make money off of taking weird photos of myself I snatched it faster than you could say 
		"the floor manager was astonishingly rude".
